# Vicky

## Who?
Chester, Diogo and JosÃ©

## What?
A chatbot for kik.

## When?
HADOUKEN DAY

## Where?
- Raspberry Pi
- Android (>= 4.1) device

## Why?

It's awesome in and of itself. Plus, we can use it for different purposes such as:

- Wingman, a bot that introduces you to a girl/guy, makes you look cool and gives basic info about you.
- Translation bot.
- Personal assistent kind of thing (how's the weather and the like)

## How?

two-parts:

- Runs the bot engine on a server (qbert or something more appropriate)
- Uses Google's ui manipulation tool to use kik on a device/emulator, talk to the bot server and respond back.

### Build instructions

#### Pre-reqs:

On your computer:

- Java SDK properly installed and configured. Tested with ([Oracle's JDK 1.7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html), but anything capable of `javac` >= v1.6 should do)
- [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) (`brew install ant` was fine)
- [ADT bundle](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) properly installed (specifically, we need to run `adb` properly)
- In this repository's `local.properties`, point `sdk.dir` to the `sdk` folder inside your ADT bundle

On the Android (>= 4.1) device

- Install [Kik](http://kik.com)
- Register/login the user to be impersonated.

#### Running locally

- (optional) Edit `LaunchSettings.java` (specifically, `getResponse` method) to change Vicky's behaviour whenever it receives a message (currently, it connects to a QBert instance to respond to messages, that is, Vicky *is* QBert).
- `./run.sh` will:
  - use Ant to build `vicky.jar` with the behaviour above
  - install it on the phone
  - close Kik client on the if running
  - run [uiautomator](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/uiautomator/index.html)

#### Running on a Raspberry Pi

- Install a recent Raspbian with standard, boot-to-command line options & some interwebz
- Download [adb for ARM](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1924492) (specifically [this file](http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1392336&d=1349930509)); copy `adb` to `/usr/local/bin`
- Install a compatible `node/npm` (the one on Raspbian's default repo is too ancient, bulding from source takes forever). [This](https://gist.github.com/adammw/3245130/raw/v0.10.24/node-v0.10.24-linux-arm-armv6j-vfp-hard.tar.gz) 0.10.24 prebuilt worked fine (just copied the tree to /usr/local/)
- Download a copy of [QBert](http://github.com/uken/hubot) (*TODO*: add additional configs here) and run it
- Build `vicky.jar` on your computer (see above), then copy `run.sh` and the bin directory (which should contain `vicky.jar`) to a directory on the device
- On the device, comment first line of run.sh (you already have `vicky.jar`)
