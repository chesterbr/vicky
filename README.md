# KikBot

## Who?
Chester, Diogo and JosÃ©

## What?
A chatbot for kik.

## When?
HADOUKEN DAY

## Where?
- Raspberry Pi ([adb built for it](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1924492))
- Android >= 4.1 device (see below)

## Why?

It's awesome in and of itself. Plus, we can use it for different purposes such as:

- Wingman, a bot that introduces you to a girl/guy, makes you look cool and gives basic info about you.
- Translation bot.
- Personal assistent kind of thing (how's the weather and the like)

## How?

two-parts:

- Runs the bot engine on a server (qbert or something more appropriate)
- Uses Google's ui manipulation tool to use kik on a device/emulator, talk to the bot server and respond back.
